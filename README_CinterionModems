Due to events being customizable in regard to which port they will 
show up on and ports being customizable in the same way, some changes
might be required to the source code.

The following edits may be necessary depending on modem configuration:

Cinterion plugin:
In interface-create calls, the last parameter shall be data->app
	or data->mdm, this defines which port ofono will listen to
	for that specific interface.
	Using the wrong port will cause ofono to miss events.

Udevng plugin:
setup_cinterion() function
	Change port assignments according to modem configuration
